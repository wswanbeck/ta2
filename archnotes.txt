Scheduler
    Read config
    Preprocess config times - figure out trip number.
    build schedule table
        last time each complete is None or anytime before today's date
    loop:
        check time and schedule
        if scheduled time to start something up AND it's not running and it's not marked complete today: 
            subscribe to feedwatcher
            mark it as running
        if time to give up on a process
            unsubscribe to feed watcher
            mark it as not running and failed to complete
            sleep for a minute 

Feedwatcher threads
    If no subscribers, do nothing
    Accept subscribe and unsubscribe requests - keep list of webhooks
        loop:
            if at least 1 subscriber:
                read the feed
                post the feed to each subscriber
            wait until 10 seconds passed since last read

Subscribers
    When post received:
        Create subscriber from url parameters and config that it points to
        check feed data from post and look for match
        If match found
            Send alert
            Notify scheduler - task is complete
